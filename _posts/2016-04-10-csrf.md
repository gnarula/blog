title: CSRF Attacks in a nutshell
categories: [Security]
---

Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is something you might have come across if
you're into web development. Even if you're not, its always good to have an
idea about how you might be vulnerable to it.

I've been working on GNOME Music and ownCloud's music app lately and a
particular feature required exposing an [internal
endpoint](https://github.com/owncloud/music/pull/485). This post is largely
inspired by ownCloud's sophisticated design to prevent CSRF attacks.

>In a CSRF attack, a malicious website attempts to impersonate your identity on
a target website by sending requests on your behalf to its advantage.

Imagine a  scenario where you're an active user of `vulnerablehost.com`, a
music player which uses an endpoint like
`http://vulnerablehost.com/add/music/?url=<url_to_file>` to enqueue music to
the playlist. While relatively unharmful at first, what if you happen to visit
another site `evilintents.com` which hides among other things, something as
frivolous as

```html
<img src="http://vulnerablehost.com/add/music?url=<evil hosts music taste>">
```

Your browser would just pass on the request and append evilhost's music to
your playlist. You might wonder if `vulnerablehost.com` could have made the endpoint
accessible only via a POST request to circumvent the attack. The only problem
is, crafty `evilintents.com` can probably fool you into submitting a form with
the target pointing to the former

```html
<!-- On evilintents.com, a seemingly harmless form -->
<form action="http://vulnerablehost.com/add/music" method="POST">
    <label for="id">ID</label>
    <input name="id" type="text">
    <input type="submit">
    <input type="hidden" name="url" value="<evil hosts music taste>">
</form>
```

To understand the possible implications of the attack, reconsider
`vulnerablehost.com` as your banking website with an endpoint to transfer funds
to a benficiary.

Prevention
----------

Fortunately, there is a way to prevent CSRF attacks on endpoints by requiring
requests to contain data that only you, the client and the server would know
and there is no way for `evilintents.com` to figure it out. This is often
referred to as a CSRF token, which is hidden along with your POST request and
enables `nonvulnerablehost.com` to ensure the requests are not send
inadvertently.

```html
<!-- Forms on nonvulnerablehost.com -->
<form action="http://nonvulnerablehost.com/add/music" method="POST">
    <label for="url">URL:</label>
    <input type="text" name="url">
    <input type="hidden" name="csrftoken" value="randomvalueknownbyserver">
</form>
```

In the above scenario, there is no way for `evilintents.com` to guess the value
of `csrftoken` that is checked on every form submission at
`nonvulnerablehost.com`, thereby rendering CSRF attacks useless :) Many
web frameworks are bundled with CSRF Middlewares that do the check on every
POST request automatically and mitigate the attack.

Conclusion
----------
Theoretically, CSRF attacks are not hard to defend against, but practically
developers often overlook
[possible](http://pouyadarabi.blogspot.in/2015/04/bypass-facebook-csrf.html)
[situations](https://bounty.github.com/classifications/cross-site-request-forgery.html).
It's not hard to look around for possible CSRF vulnerabilities. While attacks
are rarely in jest, if you're a BITSGian, logged in via Cyberoam,
chances are you'll have to login again ;)
